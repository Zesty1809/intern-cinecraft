# Back to Dashboard & Save/Discard Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a "Back to Dashboard" button on the form page with intelligent unsaved changes detection, giving users the option to save as draft or discard changes before leaving.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Back to Dashboard Button**
- **Location**: Top-right header area, next to the department name button
- **Styling**: Gray button (#6b6b6b) matching the design system
- **Icon**: Left arrow (←) for visual indication
- **Behavior**: 
  - If no changes: Navigates directly to dashboard
  - If changes detected: Shows confirmation modal

### 2. **Form Change Detection**
- **Auto-tracking**: Monitors all form inputs (text fields, textareas, file uploads)
- **Smart Detection**: Only triggers warning if user has actually made changes
- **Submit Override**: Doesn't show warning when user clicks Submit/Save Draft buttons

### 3. **Confirmation Modal**
When user clicks "Back to Dashboard" with unsaved changes:

#### Modal Design
- **Beautiful overlay**: Semi-transparent dark backdrop
- **Clean card design**: White card with rounded corners and shadow
- **Smooth animations**: Fade-in overlay + slide-up card effect

#### Three Action Buttons

1. **Discard Changes** (Red)
   - Immediately navigates to dashboard
   - All form data is lost
   - Hover effect with shadow

2. **Save as Draft** (Green)
   - Automatically submits form as draft
   - Saves all entered data (even if incomplete)
   - Returns to dashboard after save
   - Shows success toast notification

3. **Continue Editing** (Gray)
   - Closes modal
   - Returns to form
   - No data lost

### 4. **Browser Navigation Protection**
- **beforeunload event**: Warns users if they try to:
  - Close the browser tab
  - Navigate using browser back button
  - Refresh the page
- **Native browser dialog**: Shows standard "You have unsaved changes" warning
- **Smart bypass**: Doesn't show warning when user properly submits form
