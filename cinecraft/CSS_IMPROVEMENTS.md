# CSS Improvements - Departments Page

## ðŸŽ¨ Changes Made

### 1. **Department Card Layout**
- **Grid Width**: Increased minimum column width from `280px` to `300px` for better content spacing
- **Gap**: Increased gap from `16px` to `18px` for cleaner separation
- **Padding**: Increased card padding from `16px` to `18px` for better breathing room

### 2. **Text Overflow Prevention**
**Problem**: Long department names and descriptions were flowing out of the card boxes

**Solutions Implemented**:
- âœ… Added `overflow: hidden` to `.dept-card` to contain content
- âœ… Added `word-wrap: break-word` to `.dept-title` for long words
- âœ… Added `overflow-wrap: break-word` to properly break text at word boundaries
- âœ… Added `min-width: 0` to `.dept-header > div` to allow flex items to shrink
- âœ… Added `gap: 12px` to `.dept-header` for proper spacing between title and badge

### 3. **Subtitle Truncation**
**Problem**: Long subtitles could make cards look messy

**Solution**:
- âœ… Implemented 2-line clamp using `-webkit-line-clamp: 2` and `line-clamp: 2`
- âœ… Added `-webkit-box-orient: vertical` for proper line clamping
- âœ… Text shows maximum 2 lines with ellipsis for overflow

### 4. **Enhanced Visual Design**

#### Card Improvements:
- Increased border-radius from `10px` to `12px` (smoother corners)
- Enhanced box-shadow for better depth perception
- Added hover effect: slight lift (`translateY(-2px)`) with enhanced shadow
- Added smooth transitions for hover states

#### Badge Improvements:
- Increased padding from `4px 10px` to `6px 12px`
- Increased border-radius from `12px` to `16px` (pill shape)
- Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent badge from shrinking
- Added `white-space: nowrap` to keep badge text on one line

#### Button Improvements:
- Changed from `flex-wrap: wrap` to `flex-wrap: nowrap` (buttons stay on one row)
- Increased padding from `8px 12px` to `10px 14px`
- Increased border-radius from `6px` to `8px`
- Added `text-align: center` for consistent button text alignment
- Added `white-space: nowrap` to prevent button text wrapping
- Better color scheme:
  - Base: `#f3f4f6` (lighter gray)
  - Hover states: Individual colors per action
  - Edit hover: `#e5e7eb` (darker gray)
  - Deactivate hover: `#fef3c7` (yellow) with yellow text
  - Delete hover: `#fee2e2` (light red) with dark red text

#### Hover Effects:
- All buttons now lift slightly on hover (`translateY(-1px)`)
- Added colored shadows matching button action (delete = red shadow)
- Smooth transitions (0.2s ease)

### 5. **Section Title Enhancement**
- Added explicit font-size: `18px`
- Added color: `#0f172a` for consistent dark text
- Better visual hierarchy

### 6. **Empty State**
- Added `.dept-empty` styling for when no departments exist
